# PRISM Household Malaria Viewer

Interactive web-based visualization of household-level malaria surveillance data from the PRISM (Program for Resistance, Immunology, Surveillance, and Modeling of Malaria) cohort study in Uganda.

**üåê [View Live Interactive Visualization](https://edwenger.github.io/prism-data-viewer/)**

## Overview

This project provides an interactive, web-based viewer for exploring malaria infection patterns within households across three transmission intensity sites in Uganda:

- **Nagongera** - High transmission (Tororo district) - 105 households
- **Walukuba** - Medium transmission (Jinja district) - 99 households
- **Kihihi** - Low transmission (Kanungu district) - 101 households

The visualization displays longitudinal test results for all members of multi-person households, with each row representing one individual. Users can navigate between households using a dropdown menu, Previous/Next buttons, or arrow keys. Households are sorted by total number of microscopy-positive observations.

## Features

- **Interactive household navigation** - Dropdown menu, Previous/Next buttons, and arrow key support
- **Rich visualization** - Shows all visits, fever episodes, diagnostic test results, and parasite densities
- **Hover details** - Detailed information on demand for each data point
- **Multi-site support** - Separate visualizations for each transmission intensity site
- **Static hosting** - Pure HTML/JavaScript using Plotly, can be hosted on GitHub Pages

## Visualization Elements

Each individual's timeline shows:
- **All visits** - Small gray dots
- **Fever visits** - Red dots
- **Microscopy/LAMP negative** - Open circles
- **Parasite positive** - Colored/sized circles by density (log scale, yellow to red)
- **LAMP positive** - Light yellow circles (submicroscopic infections)
- **Gametocytes detected** - Olive ring around microscopy-positive results

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Process Raw Data

To regenerate the cleaned CSV files from the raw PRISM data:

```bash
python process_data.py
```

This creates `prism_cleaned_*.csv` files in the `data/` directory.

### Generate Interactive Viewers

To regenerate the HTML visualization files:

```bash
python generate_viewer.py
```

This creates/updates HTML files in the `docs/` directory.
